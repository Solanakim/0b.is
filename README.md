## Overview

:warning: This application is being developed and does not yet contain all planned functionality!

**0b.is** is a web-based service for quickly converting numbers. It provides a quick and easy-to-use way to get the results you want. The application is live at [0b.is](https://0b.is/). This domain name was chosen as it is fast to type and easy to remember. The name refers to a [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Representation) of adding the prefix *0b* to distinguish binary numbers.
